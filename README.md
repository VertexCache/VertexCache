# ![VertexCache](https://github.com/jasonlam604/VertexCache/blob/main/etc/assets/vertexcache-logo-32x32.png) What is VertexCache
VertexCache is a high-performance, open-source, in-memory caching system designed for speed, flexibility, and ease of use. Built with scalability and security in mind, it offers multi-index caching, allowing efficient data retrieval using one primary key and up to two optional secondary keys for faster lookups and reduced database I/O.

Developed in Java, VertexCache is powered by the Vertex Cache Message Protocol (VCMP)â€”an open, structured, and lightweight messaging protocol optimized for low-latency, high-throughput communication. With built-in configurable logging via Log4J, developers gain real-time visibility and debugging capabilities without compromising performance.

VertexCache is designed for seamless integration and customization, leveraging simple property-based configuration that allows users to enable, disable, or fine-tune features effortlessly. No need to reinvent the wheelâ€”VertexCache adopts industry best practices for logging, indexing, and caching, ensuring a production-ready, developer-friendly experience.

As an MIT-licensed, fully open-source project, VertexCache is available for anyone to use, modify, and extend freely. The Easy-to-Use Client SDKs allow developers to interact with VertexCache in their preferred programming language without needing to write custom VCMP clients.
