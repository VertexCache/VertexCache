**VertexCache** is a fast, secure, open-source in-memory caching system built for modern workloads.  
Designed as a developer-first solution, VertexCache combines multi-index lookups, wire-efficient messaging, and built-in encryption â€” all optimized for performance and control.

Lightweight by design. Secure by default. High-performance TCP clients in your language of choice.

---

### Our Mission

**To do one thing and do it well â€” caching â€” guided by the core tenets of Security, Flexibility, and Simplicity.**

---

### Why VertexCache?

- **Multi-Index Caching** â€” Query by primary, secondary, or tertiary keys  
- **Multi-Tenant Support** â€” Isolate tenants and enforce role-based access with the AuthModule  
- **Custom Binary Protocol (VCMP)** â€” Low-latency, wire-efficient messaging  
- **Encrypted Communication** â€” TLS, RSA, AES-GCM built-in  
- **Pluggable Eviction** â€” LRU, LFU, TinyLFU, ARC, FIFO, and more  
- **Minimal Config** â€” Simple `.env`-style setup, no YAML or XML required  
- **First-Class Developer SDKs** â€” Official high-performance **TCP clients**, not REST wrappers:  
  - **C#, Elixir, Go, Java, Kotlin, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust**  
- **Optional REST API** â€” Lightweight HTTP access for environments where TCP isn't suitable  
- **Fully Open-Source** â€” Apache 2.0 license

### Available Modules

VertexCache is modular â€” extend functionality only when needed:

- **AdminModule** â€” Powerful admin commands: `purge`, `metrics`, `config`, `reload`, `reset`, `session`, `shutdown`, `status`  
- **AlertModule** â€” Webhook alerts for external monitoring; integrates with SmartModule  
- **AuthModule** â€” Secure, role-based client authentication with multi-tenant support  
- **ClusterModule** â€” Hot-standby clustering for high availability  
- **MetricModule** â€” Real-time performance metrics and cache insights  
- **RateLimiterModule** â€” Built-in traffic rate limiting  
- **RestAPIModule** â€” Optional REST API for simplified HTTP integration  
- **SmartModule** â€” Advanced features including indexing and future TTL optimization  

---

### Load Testing & Benchmarking

- **VertexBench** â€” Official load testing suite for stress testing, QPS analysis, and real-world scenario validation  
Ideal for tuning configurations, validating cluster performance, and measuring throughput under load.

---

### Built for Real-World Complexity

Under the hood, VertexCache prioritizes interoperability, fault-tolerance, and security:

- **Binary Protocol Enforcement** â€” VCMP ensures minimal overhead with predictable framing  
- **Layered Encryption Stack** â€” Combine transport security (TLS) with message-layer RSA or AES-GCM  
- **Cluster-Ready by Design** â€” Hot-standby, promotable secondaries with automatic or manual failover  
- **Modular Activation** â€” Deploy only what you need: SmartModule, AdminModule, Rate Limiting, Alerts  
- **Cross-Language SDK Consistency** â€” Identical protocol handling across all official TCP clients  
- **Predictable Operational Behavior** â€” Console-driven diagnostics, detailed metrics, and admin commands  

All engineered to deliver fast, controlled caching â€” without sacrificing security or operational clarity.
