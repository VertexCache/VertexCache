# What is VertexCache?
VertexCache is a straightforward in-memory caching system designed with a strong emphasis on security. It supports a 
range of algorithms and offers multi-index caching capabilities, allowing for efficient data retrieval using one primary 
key and two secondary keys.

VertexCache is implemented in Java and uses a straightforward, string-based protocol call VCMP (VertexCacheProtocolMessage) for message delivery, which is transmitted over the wire as bytes.
