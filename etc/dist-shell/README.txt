What is VertexCache?
--------------------
VertexCache is a straightforward in-memory caching system designed with a strong emphasis on security. It supports a
range of algorithms and offers multi-index caching capabilities, allowing for efficient data retrieval using one
primary key and two secondary keys.

VertexCache is implemented in Java and uses a straightforward, string-based protocol called
VCMP (VertexCacheProtocolMessage) for message delivery, which is transmitted over the wire as bytes.
