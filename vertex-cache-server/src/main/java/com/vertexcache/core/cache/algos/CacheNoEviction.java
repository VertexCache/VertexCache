/*
 * A simple cache strategy that performs no automatic eviction.
 *
 * This implementation allows the cache to grow without bounds,
 * limited only by the JVMâ€™s memory. It is best suited for use cases
 * where the dataset is known to be small or externally managed,
 * such as static configuration or always-hot reference data.
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - No size enforcement (sizeCapacity is ignored)
 * - No eviction is ever triggered automatically
 * - All entries remain until explicitly removed
 *
 * Secondary indexes (idx1, idx2) are supported, and reverse indexing
 * is used for efficient cleanup of associated mappings.
 *
 * Use with caution in environments with limited memory.
