/**
 * Administrative command that triggers a graceful shutdown of the VertexCache server.
 *
 * Initiates an orderly shutdown process, including:
 * - Closing all client connections
 * - Flushing any pending operations (if applicable)
 * - Releasing internal resources
 *
 * This command is intended for controlled maintenance workflows or scripted shutdowns.
 * It does not restart the processâ€”external process supervision is required to bring the server back up.
 *
 * Requires ADMIN privileges and explicit confirmation (e.g., SHUTDOWN CONFIRM) to execute.
